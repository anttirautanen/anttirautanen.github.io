title: Free Weekend!
---

This weekend is special for me: the rest of the family is travelling and I have the house for myself. It means that I have some spare time for this game project of mine!

I'll call the game "MA" for now. I'll show in this post what I have done so far and then after the weekend blog about the results.

The game is about building and managing a public transport network. For now I have narrowed it to just metro stations.

I have done two main features so far:

1/2: Map editing: player can edit the walkable surface in which people can move:

</div> 

2/2: Pathfinding: people find the shortest route from start to finish and then go there:

</div> 

I have a few features in my mind that I want to try this weekend. One is adding some gates through which the people must go. Another is that people need to visit a ticket machine before going through the gate. 

I'll post again on Sunday about the results. See you then!
