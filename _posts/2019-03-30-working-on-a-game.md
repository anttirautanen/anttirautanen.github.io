title: Working on a Game
---

I've been enthusiastic gamer ever since my first PC. Titles like Grand Theft Auto, Transport Tycoon Deluxe, Command and Conquer: Generals, Operation Flashpoint and more recently Arma, Prison Architect and Cities: Skylines describe my taste well. All are heavy with simulation (realistic or not) and large open worlds.

Making games instead of just playing them has been on my bucket list for quite some time. I noticed my interest with Operation Flashpoint which is a highly scriptable game. I used to create custom missions, either player vs AI or even AI vs AI and just watch.

Recently I have started to learn [Unity](https://unity.com) to create my first game. It will be yet another platformer... There is a twist, but the main goal of the game is to learn Unity and get a game — any game — released.

After the first game is released, I hope to continue making another game, but this time move closer to my favourite game genre.

I will be posting into this blog about the games and about my journey into game development in general.
